Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:

Mat size must be N X M. (N is an odd natural number, and M is 3 times N)
The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.
The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.
"""

n, m = map(int,input().split())
pattern = [('.|.'*(2*i + 1)).center(m, '-') for i in range(n//2)]
print('\n'.join(pattern + ['WELCOME'.center(m, '-')] + pattern[::-1]))
